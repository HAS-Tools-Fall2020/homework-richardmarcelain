Marcelain 8/31 Assignment 1

I made this semester's forecast by using daily values of the previous year.  I averaged daily values into weekly values beginning with the prediction date and ending one day prior to the following 
	prediction date.  I then gave averages to match the dates used in this assignment's prediction calendar, with the assumption that no significant streamflow change would occur between this 
	year and last year.
