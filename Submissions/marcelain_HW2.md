# Marcelain 9/7 Assignment 2

I made this week's forecast using the python code provided for the week 2 assignment.  I added a loop structure to grab single values (not averaged) from calendar dates in 1993 matching the forecast entry dates for 2020.

# Grade
3/3 - Nice work! I like all the things you added really great.
One note, for now I would prefer that you stick in python scripts and not use jupyter notebooks though. Don't worry we will get to those too!
